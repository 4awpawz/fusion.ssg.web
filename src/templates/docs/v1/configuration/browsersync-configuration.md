<em>CONFIGURATION</em>

 <p class="warn">Beginning with fusion.ssg v1.3.0 the warning about a missing 404.html file is no longer implemented in browsersync.js, and is handled internally by fusion.ssg. If you are upgrading a project to v1.3.0 or greater then you need to remove the following from your project's browsersync.js file which is located in your project's root folder:</p>

`console.log(chalk.yellowBright("Warning: this site is missing a 404.html doc - using default 404.html."));`

# browsersync-options.json

<p class="ver">Introduced in v1.0.0</p>

By default, fusion.ssg projects generated by fusion.ssg's project generator, <a href="{baseURL}/docs/{docsCurrentVersion}/projectgenerator">fpg</a>, come with a default <a href="https://browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a> implementation, _/browsersync.js_, which configures Browsersync to use the following options for serving both _development_ and _release_ builds:

```javascript
server: "build",
files: "build/**",
watch: true
```

If you have assigned a value for <a href="{baseURL}/docs/{docsCurrentVersion}/configuration/fusionssg-configuration#baseurl">&lbrace;baseURL&rbrace;</a>, the _startPath_ option will be assigned the value of &lbrace;baseURL&rbrace; and added to the above set of options.

Should you have the need to modify Browsersync's default options, you can do so by adding options to the "development" and "release" properties found in the _/browsersync-options.json_ file. By default, both are empty:

```json
{
    "development": {
    },
    "release": {
    }
}
```
<p class="info">A complete list of configuration options is available at <a href="https://browsersync.io/docs/options">Browsersync options</a>.</p>

<p class="info">If you have the need to make major changes to Browsersync's configuration, it might be better to consider creating your own Browsersync implementation to replace the default implementation.</p>
