## Breaking Changes

- None!

## New Features

### Tokenization Metric Reporting

- Issue# 82: Add metrics reporting to the console for the tokenize service.

fusion.ssg will now include metrics for tokenization.
### Exposing More Post Metadata As Simple Token Values

- Issue# 84: When tokenizing a post, expose its post date, categories and tags as simple token values.

When tokenizing a post, fusion.ssg will expose a post's _post date_, _categories_, and _tags_ as simple token values, allowing them to be used as simple tokens in your templates, pages and includes. This will serve to mitigate the need of having to use a component just to include these in your HTML documents.

- &lbrace;postDate&rbrace;: the post's post date, derived from its file name, transformed to a locale date string.
- &lbrace;categories&rbrace;: the post's categories, declared in the post's front matter, transformed to a path where multiple categories are separated from each other using "/".
- &lbrace;tags&rbrace;: the post's tags, declared in the post's front matter, as a comma separated list.

### WIPS Reporting During Release Builds

- Issue# 85: Report all WIPS to the console when building for release.

fusion.ssg will now report all WIPS for each release build cycle. These warnings will serve to prevent the _unintended_ updating of web sites with missing HTML documents that should have been included but aren't because they are still marked as WIPS.

### Cache Busting

- Issue# 88: Add direct support for cache busting via 4awpawz/buster.

<img style="float: left; border-radius: 50%; shape-outside: circle(); margin-right: 10px;" src="{baseURL}/media/posts/buster.png" alt="image" width="100">
<p>When building for release, fusion.ssg will <em>optionally</em> cache bust your site's assets (e.g. css, media, scripts, .etc), allowing your site's visitors to immediately experience its latest changes. Specifically, to <em>opt in to cache busting your release builds</em>, you will need to append <code>--cache-bust</code> to the <em>release:fusion</em> script located in your project's <em>package.json</em> file. Once appended, the release:fusion script should look exactly like the following:</p>

```json
"release:fusion": "fusion release --cache-bust",
```
fusion.ssg handles all the details, so no additional configuration or changes to your projects other than the above change to your package.json file's release:fusion script is required to enhance your sites with cache busting.

<p class="info">fusion.ssg relies on <a href="https://github.com/4awpawz/buster">Buster</a>, which is a very capable and resilient cache busting tool developed by the same team that brings you fusion.ssg, to implement its cache busting.</p>

### Conditional Includes

- Issue# 89: Provide the ability to make the composition of includes conditional based on build strategy using configuration.

Conditional includes allow you to designate that an include's content is _relevant only for release builds_ or is _relevant only for development builds_.

Why would you might use this? For example, suppose your site includes some content that is only relevant in a release build, such as Google analytics for example, you will now be able to exclude this content when building your site for development.

To support this feature, _fusion.json_ will now support the following property:

```json
"conditionalIncludes": {
    "developmentOnly": ["path/to/include/relative/to/src/includes", ...],
    "releaseOnly": ["path/to/include/relative/to/src/includes", ...],
}
```

If an include's path matches one of these conditions, its content will only be included for the targeted build strategy.
