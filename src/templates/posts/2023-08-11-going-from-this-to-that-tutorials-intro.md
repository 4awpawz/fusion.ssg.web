## Introduction

This series assumes that you have no prior knowledge and so we start with the basics and slowly progress to the more advanced topics.

Upon completing this series, we sincerely hope that you will have learned how easy it is to create your own resilient HTML documents and websites using fusion.ssg.

We look forward to your participation and hope that you enjoy this series and find it informative.
