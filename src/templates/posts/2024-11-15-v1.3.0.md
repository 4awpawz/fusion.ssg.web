We are very pleased to announce the release of fusion.ssg v1.3.0. This release includes new features, enhancements, and a number of bug fixes.

<!-- end -->

Please note that beginning with this release, release notes will now only highlight _the most important new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and breaking changes_. A __detailed change log__ that includes all the issues and their associated labels addressed per release is now separately maintained and is available [here](https://github.com/4awpawz/fusion.ssg/blob/main/changelog.md).

Sincerely,

The Team

## v1.3.0 Highlights

### New projects can now be created without scaffolding.

A new option, `--bare`, has been added to fusions.ssg's project generator, __fpg__, that allows you to generate new projects without scaffolding. 

Example:

```shell
`fpg n | new --bare <target_folder>`
```

### Tokens in inline scripts and code blocks are now ignored.

You can now safely use tokens in inline scripts and code blocks without fusion.ssg complaining that they are unresolved.

<hr>

### The reserved `baseURL` token can now be used in your project's css files.

If you are building a site that has background images and your project employs the use of fusion.ssg's reserved <a href="{baseURL}/docs/v1/configuration/fusionssg-configuration/#baseurl"><code style="text-decoration: underline;">baseURL</code></a> token with a value other than `''`, you no longer have to declare 2 URLs for the image, one for development builds, and one for release builds. Instead, you can now prepend the URL with fusion.ssg's reserved `baseURL` token and the URL will resolve properly for both development and release builds.

Example:

```css
.hero {
    background-image: url({baseURL}/media/stretching-cat.png);
}
```
<br>
<hr>

### Console output related to Typescript compilation now explicitly states if it is for _components_ or for _browser scripts_.

This distinction was not made in previous versions.

<hr>

### Metrics reporting to the console after each build cycle now defaults to a condensed set of metrics for both development and release builds.

The detailed metrics reporting of previous versions is still available via the `--verbose` option and can be applied to either development or release builds or to both.

New default metrics reporting example:

<img src="{baseURL}/media/posts/condensedmetricsreporting.png" alt="condensed metrics reporting" width="600">
<br>
<br>
Metrics reporting with the --verbose option example:
<br>
<br>
<img src="{baseURL}/media/posts/verbosemetricsreporting.png" alt="verbose metrics reporting" width="600">

<br>
<br>
<hr>

### Eliminate multiple "project does not contain a 404.html document" warnings when refreshing the browser.

Beginning with fusion.ssg v1.3.0 the warning about a missing 404.html file is no longer implemented in browsersync.js, and is handled internally by fusion.ssg.

 <p class="warn">If you are upgrading a project to v1.3.0 or greater then you should remove the following from your project's browsersync.js file which is located in your project's root folder:</p>

`console.log(chalk.yellowBright("Warning: this site is missing a 404.html doc - using default 404.html."));`

<hr>

## Breaking Changes

- None!
