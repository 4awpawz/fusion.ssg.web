# {title}
We are changing how we use semantic versioning for development builds.
<!-- end -->

Our prior releases were marked as _beta_ because these were still pre-production releases and we wanted to be _open and transparent_ about their status.

Beginning with the next release, which will be our first production release, we will be dropping the use of _beta_ when versioning a development release. Going forward, all development releases will use `-dev.n` instead of -beta.n.

As such, the next release of fusion.ssg will be _v1.0.0_ and the next development release would be _vn.n.n-dev.1.

As we greatly appreciate our small but growing community of users, we promise to remain open and transparent with you about the status of our project.

Sincerely,

The Team
