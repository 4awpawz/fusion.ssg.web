## Breaking Changes

- None!

## New Features

- Issue# 81: Note and report all unresolved tokens per HTML document.

During each build cycle, fusion.ssg now *__searches all generated HTML documents for unresolved simple tokens__* (e.g. &lbrace;some-simple-token&rbrace;) and reports them as a warning in the console. These warnings indicate that either the token name has been _misspelled or that its value has not been declared_ in either the template or in your project's configuration file, fusion.json. For more information, please see <a href="{baseURL}/docs/{docsCurrentVersion}/htmldocuments/tokens#simple-tokens">simple tokens</a> and <a href="{baseURL}/docs/{docsCurrentVersion}/configuration/fusionssg-configuration/#tokens">fusion.json</a>.

# Bug Fixes

- Issue #80: Verify the src/scripts folder exists before serializing its content to the build/scripts folder.

Though there hadn't been any reported issues regarding this, we felt the best practice would be to be preemptive and to check first. This would have been an issue if, for instance, you deleted the src/scripts folder because your site didn't employ any JavaScript in the browser.
