# Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` and runs on `Node`.

## The Name

_fusion_ plays on the idea of seamlessly **_fusing_** together various technologies like HTML, Markdown, TypseScript and JavaScript Components, JSON Data, YAML Front Matter, etc., to seamlessly work together to simplify the creation of HTML documents and static websites.

## Project Scope
The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and websites and requires no knowledge of other front-end frameworks. This keeps the scope of the project focused and prevents feature creep.

## Current Status

<p class="ver">{version}</p>

## Versioning

We use <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.

## Long Term Goals

- Seek RFC.
- Accept pull requests when the codebase is stable enough to receive them, which will probably coincide with the first major release.
