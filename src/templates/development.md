# fusion.ssg

fusion.ssg seamlessly fuses together _HTML, Markdown, TypseScript/JavaScript Components, JSON, and YAML Front Matter_ in one cohesive development platform to simplify the creation of resilient HTML documents and static websites.

## Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` and runs on `Node`.

## Project Scope
The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and websites and requires no knowledge of other front-end frameworks. This keeps the scope of the project focused and prevents feature creep.

## Current Status

<p class="ver">{version}</p>

## Versioning

We use <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.

## Long Term Goals

- Seek RFC.
- Accept pull requests when the codebase is stable enough to receive them, which will probably coincide with the first major release.
