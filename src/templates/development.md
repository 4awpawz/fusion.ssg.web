# Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` and runs on `Node`.

## The Name

_fusion_ plays on the idea of seamlessly **_fusing_** together various technologies like HTML, Markdown, TypseScript and JavaScript Components, JSON Data, YAML Front Matter, etc., to seamlessly work together to simplify the creation of HTML documents and static websites.

## Project Scope
The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and nothing else. It will not provide any other tooling other than what is absolutely necessary to accomplish that. Importantly, fusion.ssg requires no knowledge of front-end frameworks like React. This keeps the scope of the project focused, preventing feature creep, and benefits users who will be able to pick and chose their own tools.

## Current Status

<p class="ver">{version}</p>

## Versioning

We use <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.

## Long Term Goals

- Seek RFC.
- Accept pull requests when the codebase is stable enough to receive them, which will probably coincide with the first major release.
