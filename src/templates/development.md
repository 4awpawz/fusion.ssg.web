# Project Development

The project is written in ` TypeScript` and runs on `Node`.

## The Name

_fusion_ plays on the idea of seamlessly **_fusing_** together various technologies, e.g. HTML, Markdown, TypseScript Components, JSON Data, YAML Front Matter, etc., to seamlessly work together to simplify the creation of HTML documents and static websites.

## Project Scope
The project's scope is limited to generating robust and resilient HTML documents and nothing else. It will not provide any other tooling other than what is absolutely necessary to accomplish that. Importantly, fusion.ssg requires no knowledge of front-end frameworks like React. This keeps the scope of the project focused, preventing feature creep, and benefits users who will be able to pick and chose their own tools.

## Current Status

The project is still in its  v1.0.0-beta stage. Beta releases should be considered _stable_. While in Beta, features and implementations might change dramatically and this should be considered the norm.

## Versioning

Beginning with v1.0.0, which will be our first production release, we will be dropping the use of _beta_ when versioning a development release. Going forward, all development releases will use `-dev.n` instead of -beta.n.

## Long Term Goals

- Seek RFC.
- Accept pull requests when the codebase is stable enough to receive them, which will probably coincide with the first major release.
